# BNB Miner Compounder

This program is used to auto-compound the fantom miner at shorter intervals than a human would want to do.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install) to install the dependancies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To use the program you need to create a .env file that the program can load, a sample file is given in [.env-sample.txt](.env-sample.txt)

Inside you'll have to input the RPC URL of the BNB network. Then you will have to put in the private key of your wallet, this can be obtained by a quick google (do not share this with anyone)
